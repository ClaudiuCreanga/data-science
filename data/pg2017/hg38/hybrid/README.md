# Hybrid truthsets

These 'hybrid' truthsets were generated by merging Genome in a Bottle
high confidence calls (hg001, v3.3.2) with those from the Platinum
Genomes truthset for the same sample (NA12878, v2017-1.0). Merged
records were validated by performing a k-mer test on alignments from
the lower pedigree CEPH 1463 (11 children). Records with k-mer support
via haplotype inheritance were added to the hybrid truthset.
