Overview
========

As part of Illumina's Platinum Genomes project we have derived a set of
high-confidence and phased variant calls for NA12877 and NA12878. We did this 
by taking into account the inheritance constraints in the pedigree and the
concordance of variant calls across different methods.

Version history
===============

Version: 2017-1.0
Data: SNVs and small indels for hg38 and hg19
Date: 28 June 2017
--------------------------------------------
 - Includes new 'hybrid' truthsets for NA12878 which merge
   Genome in a Bottle v3.3.2 calls with PG 2017.1 using k-mer validation
 - Improved confident regions:
    - STRs are masked from confident regions if they are only
      partially covered
    - Low density confident regions are filtered via sliding window
 - Bug fixes and tweaks:
    - All truthset records are now normalised (left-shifted
      and reference trimmed)
    - Truthset insertions have an additional confidence base
      added for proper hap.py counting

Version: 2016-1.0
Data: SNVs and small indels for hg38 and hg19
Date: 6 June 2016
---------------------------------------------
- Submission of manuscript.
- Implementation of k-mer filtering.
- ConfidentRegions.bed is now the same for all pedigree members.
- Clean-ups in the VCFs: less cluttered INFO fields and removal
  of non-PASSing records.
- Change of versioning scheme: hg38 and hg19 builds are now released together
  in the same bundle under a common release id.

Version: hg19/8.0.1, hg38/2.0.1
Data: SNVs and small indels for hg38 and hg19
