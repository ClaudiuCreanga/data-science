KNIME Analytics Platform is popular both with its large and enthusiastic user community as well as IT analysts, who regularly place us in their leaders category  next to some very surprised industry dinosaurs, btw. But we are most proud of the consistently high marks we get for user satisfaction. Our open secret: we are transforming the data-science landscape by providing an open source (and free) platform that lets data scientists mix and match the tools and methods they want while helping enterprises responsibly integrate advanced analytics into their operations. In this way, KNIME helps organizations nurture new user populations that want to exploit the benefits of data science and advanced analytics while remaining strongly committed to open source.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p><p>You like to develop visualizations to help others understand and explore data and have a good amount of experience working with JavaScript frameworks like D3 that are used for building modern interactive visualizations. You have good sense of what it means to make a visualization eye catching without sacrificing usability. Ideally you also have some experience writing java code to massage the (possibly large) data into the right format. If you have a background in doing data analytics / data science thatd even be better, but if not youll learn it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Whats the job?</strong></p><p>The areas at KNIME you could be working in are manifold. However, you would start by migrating some of the visualization components in KNIME Analytics Platform to JavaScript. That may sound like reworking an existing codebase but its mostly about writing new code  except that we have a bunch of examples to learn from/be inspired by. To get some idea of what this means have look at one of Christians <a href=""https://www.knime.org/blog/from-d3-example-to-interactive-knime-view-in-10-minutes"" rel=""nofollow"">blog posts</a> (though we doubt that he really did it in 10 minutes). This could easily keep you busy for a long, long time but depending on your interest and (our) priorities you might also work on improving the KNIME Webportal, which combines all these standalone views into a powerful application, or -- to take this a bit further -- work with the team bringing the whole KNIME application into the browser. You would be closely working with Oleg, Christian, Greg and Bernd but also be in touch with a lot more folks as in the end your work is of high interest to not only the company but the entire KNIME community.</p><p><br></p>We are looking for someone to join us in one of our offices in Berlin or Konstanz.

"machine-learning, java, elasticsearch, bigdata, clojure","<p>Polecat helps companies extract intelligence from large volumes of unstructured data to help them make better decisions. We're a small team working on a new, ambitious product and we'd like to add additional Software Engineers to accelerate our progress.</p><br /><p><strong>The product</strong>&nbsp;is designed to help companies understand and manage their online reputation, providing actionable intelligence from unstructured data. We gather huge volumes of data from online and broadcast media, social networks, discussion forums and many other sources and enrich it to discover the companies, people, topics, events and relationships. We analyse this data to identify themes, trends and relationships, helping our customers understand and manage their digital footprint. They can then measure their reputation performance and identify potential problems they need to address. We do this for some of the largest companies in the world, and are now developing the next generation of our platform and products.</p><br /><p><strong>The opportunity</strong>&nbsp;is enormous, for this product and others we have planned. The fundamental capability of tracking reputation in real time is extremely valuable to companies. Some 28 percent of a UK company's value is accounted for by reputation, according to the small and mid-cap sentiment index, compiled by the Quoted Companies Alliance and accountancy firm BDO. To keep up the momentum on new features and be able to respond rapidly to new market knowledge and feedback, we need more engineers on the team.</p><br /><p><strong>As a Polecat Software Engineer</strong>&nbsp;you'll be able to contribute within the team from day one. We tackle product missions together, sharing context, proposing hypotheses and looking for the fastest way to a solution that demonstrably succeeds. We aim for metric-driven decisions and iteration to achieve outcomes. We'll help you develop knowledge of our systems and where the boundaries of feasibility lie. We'll collaborate on design and planning and you'll work alongside other engineers to build solutions, pairing or not as makes sense. In common with the rest of the team, you'll be expected to both play to your strengths (making the most of previous experience for instance) but also be prepared to pick up the tasks furthest from your comfort zone when that's what's required to help the team move forwards on a given day.</p><br /><p><strong>New technology</strong>&nbsp;features strongly in our recent work - whatever gets us the best outcome quickly. Some of the technologies we've introduced recently include Clojure, Elasticsearch, Kafka (including Kafka Streams) and React with most-js - however part of the role is to help us evolve rapidly and use the right tools at the right times, so the technologies are likely to change over time. We have a mix of frontend- and backend-focused staff on the team but we'd like to add people who are happy to work across either.</p><br /><p><strong>You'll work on</strong>&nbsp;data processing logic running under stream processing frameworks; data indexing and retrieval services; backends that support our frontends and the frontend products themselves; plus APIs for internal consumption and for partner access. At present backends are a mixture of Clojure and Java and most recent frontend projects are React-based. We have an internal mission to create a great environment for technology experimentation within the company.</p><br /><p><strong>Working for Polecat</strong>&nbsp;you'll work with nice, smart people with chances to socialise regularly and an annual whole-company conference. You'll benefit from significant work flexibility but also a great office location in Bristol. You'll be able to follow your interests and influence how things work. You'll find big ideas are welcomed and be surprised by how fast the company evolves.</p><br /><br /><p>When we interview you, there are some specifics we'll be looking for.</p><br /><p><strong>You care about and drive outcomes</strong>. This means you ensure you understand what we're trying to achieve and look beyond simply writing code to understand the big picture and make good judgements about exactly which quality attributes are important for a piece of work. As a software engineer you should be accountable to outcomes of software change, not lines of code written or unit test coverage.</p><br /><p><strong>You're well-practised at proposing ideas</strong>. Creativity is a skill and requires practice. We're looking for people who will contribute and indeed advocate for their own ideas or equally will get behind ideas from others.</p><br /><p><strong>You work well in a collaborative environment</strong>. Good collaboration requires good communication, openness, compromise, courage, trust and respect. You'll be able to talk about plenty of examples of all of those behaviours.</p><br /><p><strong>You're not fazed by tough problems</strong>. We hit plenty of difficult issues and can't afford to get stuck. There's always a way around, but you'll need to demonstrate the tenacity, systems thinking and creativity needed to find it.</p><br /><p><strong>You believe the team comes first</strong>. You understand deeply and intuitively that we'll achieve more if we work together. You'll prioritise helping a team-mate over your own individual box-ticking.</p><br /><p><strong>You believe there's always room for improvement</strong>. You'll always be teaching yourself new skills and you'll demand opportunities to continue that learning at work. You'll apply the same instinct to continuous improvement to your work and the processes that affect it, looking for ways to increase automation and reduce waste.</p><br /><p><strong>Technical skills</strong>: To get on well with our more recent codebases, you are going to need a good understanding of functional programming and ideally either Clojure or Ramda (or both, or at least something similar and the will to learn). Other language experience that would be relevant are F#, Haskell, Scala, Java 8, ES6. Reactive programming would give you a head-start on our frontend codebase - rx-js, most, cycle-js, redux.</p><br /><p>We will expect applicants to be familiar with modern SCM tools, ideally git.
